# Dot Files   

dot files (file names that begin with a period) in the home directory contain the configurations of certain programs. They are kept in this repo so that they can easily be installed on a new system.

*./make.sh* will back up any existing of the list of dot files to be installed and then create symlinks to the ones contained here.
